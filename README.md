# Email analysis notes and reports
  
This repository is a showcase of my email analysis work — course notes, techniques, and hands-on reports analyzing phishing/emails. It’s part of my cybersecurity portfolio and demonstrates my ability to dig into suspicious messages, understand attack vectors, and produce professional reports.  
  
## Course notes
These are notes I took while following [the Security Operations 101 course by Andrew Prince](https://academy.tcm-sec.com/p/security-operations-soc-101). The course focuses on practical skills with real phishing samples and has helped me a lot. The course notes are my personal study notes. They are shared here only as part of my personal learning portfolio. Please support the original creator by purchasing the course.

## Reports
In these reports, I use the skills I learned during the course on real phishing samples that are downloaded from [Phishing Pot](https://github.com/rf-peixoto/phishing_pot) by [Peixoto](https://github.com/rf-peixoto). Each report has a link to the file on their repository. The analysis and reports are my own work.
